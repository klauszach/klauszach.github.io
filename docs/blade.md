## Finishing A Blade

I spent part of a summer making a blade for a client. I have been learning blacksmithing slowly over the course of almost four years as of the writing of this, and this was the first time I have tried to document the process. These pictures are some of the milestones along the way.

Starting with no particular plan and a dull file, I worked the steel (quite roughly) into shape by hammer and anvil.

The hatching from the steel’s previous life as a file is quite evident. As a nod to its origins I decided to try and preserve some of this pattern through the final product. While hammering it into shape, some of the edges became bulged: this is especially evident along the spine of the blade. I took to it with files and a belt grinder, beginning to remove all of the excess material from the final shape of the blade.

After some more profiling with files and sandpaper, I hardened the steel using the yaki-ire clay hardening technique. This heat treatment was developed by Japanese bladesmiths, and is worthy of much more attention than I can give it here. I did not photograph the process: I was fully occupied by not cracking the brittle martensite phase that forms when steel is quenched. Once hardened, steel becomes much easier to polish (smaller grain size and less plastic deformation lead to smaller and flatter planes where polishing compound breaks off flakes of steel).

I worked this blade up to a two thousand grit finish by hand before using a motorized leather strop to bring it to a mirror shine. Leather strops hold very fine abrasive in the pores in the leather, fantastic for all things shiny and sharp.

At this point, several new members of the cast and crew made their entrance. That slotted rectangle on the left of the above image is the guard (in traditional parlance the *Tsuba*). It started as a pile of copper and nickel plates, which were welded together to form a composite material known as mokume gane. Here is yet another component that needs its own story written out. This particular piece had been sitting in a paper bag for almost a year before I found it a home at the base of this blade.

Some quality time went into fitting the slot in the guard to the profile of the steel so that it could slide up the slight taper from the back of the blade. In addition to the visual pattern of the mokume gane, I also added a small stylized brass ‘E’ to the back of the guard. Filing brass is fun: golden snowflakes fall all around and I glisten for days. I had also just installed some new lights on my workbench, and quite enjoyed the aesthetic duo of new brass and an old steel clamp.

I soldered the two pieces into one with a blowtorch and tin solder, using borax as a flux. It splattered and left a wonderful and accidental oxidation pattern on the bare copper of the back of the guard. Plunging the whole of it into water immediately after the solder hardened left a dark oxidized layer on the nickel. I lightly buffed the brass boss and decided not to meddle with the beauty the torch had left.

All that remained was the handle and guard. They were cut from the same block of beech wood.

A hole was drilled for a single copper pin to pass through the handle and tang of the blade, relying on a constant and slight taper for a very tight, yet easily removable, fixture. Another hole was drilled slightly undersized for a short length of copper pipe to snugly wedge in. I sanded it lightly and made a stain using white vinegar and steel filings.

Yes. I put blood in my homemade woodstains.

Fifteen coats of this vile-looking potion later, I placed the handle into an oven set to low for an hour and a half. This baked out all of the moisture: prime for a finishing coat of mineral oil. I slid the copper pipe into the pommel while everything was dripping with oil and gently flared the two ends with a ball peen hammer to secure it. All that remained was to slide the blade in and pin it into place, and a knife was born.
