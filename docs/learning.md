## Knowledge and Skill

I am currently a full time student: learning is a big part of that. Here are my thoughts. This was written in February of 2020 in Madrid, Spain.

I believe that the value of education is centered in skill. This view stems from, I think, my upbringing amidst the ubiquity of information in the modern world and my own personal experiences within my educational career. Before I give justification for my views, I will offer a definition of what I mean by skill. Merriam Webster offers three definitions for the noun, of which I find: “the ability to use one’s knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance” to be the most suited to my arguments. I don’t refer to physical coordination or craftsmanship per se, but the broader idea of the action of taking an idea and enacting that idea into some form of reality. The carpenter who imagines a chair and then acts upon her surroundings in the form of tools and manual labor to create a physical manifestation of that idea is a concrete example. Skill, however, is not limited to physical creation: a mathematician reformulates equalities until a greater truth is unveiled, this too is a skillful act. In short, skill is the connections between the world of our minds and the craft at hand.



A language class is an excellent illustration of why I think education is best when it is centered on skill. I remember once having a paradigm (long before I knew the word paradigm) of foreign language as, in the words of Annie Dillard: “a code for English.” Where the concept of language is a universal constant, and different languages simply use different words for the same things. Obviously, this is quite wrong. So, when we learn a language, we must start with some vocabulary: but that is not enough. So much so, that a language class which consisted purely of vocabulary tests would certainly do a poor job preparing the students to speak, read and listen to the language in context. The skill of language is in creating phrases that match to some meaning, or in gleaning meaning from a combination of words. The words are necessary, of course, but in of themselves they are not language.


Education at its worst forgets that knowledge is not formed in a vacuum. It presents each idea as an island instead of a node. Unfortunately, testing is a skill unto itself– if it weren’t there would be no way to teach the host of test-prep classes. A test can provide a false habitat for the knowledge at hand and sometimes the skills pertinent to the knowledge can be substituted for the skill of test taking. Once that habitat is removed (often through the miracle of graduation), the knowledge is without context, and fades away. In my experience with AP and IB programs in high school, this was the norm, and I consider it a great tragedy.


Education at its best is focused on the application or meaning of the material at hand: the knowledge in its natural habitat. As an engineering student, I have found that a focus on underlying themes (What does it mean? What does it do? What are the patterns?) embraces this approach best and, frankly, makes classes easier. We are almost always presented information in a linear manner– even this essay doesn’t escape that– but it is best stored in our minds when each idea is netted to others. In these connections lies the skill.
