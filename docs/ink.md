## Ink From Spain

I decided to draw something every day of the year of 2020. Many were scrawled late at night when I realized that I had not touched paper the whole day. Some turned out alright. You’d think that my handwriting would’ve improved some, but no such luck. Spending the spring semester abroad in Madrid as a student at Carlos III yielded these sketches. I found the constant exercise to result in improvement over time so I have listed some of my personal favorites here chronologically to show that.

As of the tenth of March 2020, all CU study abroad programs in Spain have been suspended. I plan on continuing with my daily drawing, but these sketches now capture something far more ephemeral than I had planned.
